# Sorting algorithms in C

### What is this?
This repository is a little C programming exercise with the goal to implement common sorting algorithms in plain C99. To make this a bit more fun we'll benchmark all contributions with a test dataset to determine who wrote the fastest code :)

### Dependencies
- make 4.2.1
- gcc 9.2.0

### TODO
- Implement ALL the sorting algorithms
- Generate test datasets
- Template standard reporting format for testing on machines with differing hardware
